## **Data Engineering Test**

### **Introduction**
This test is meant to demonstrate your technical abilities and proficiency with Big Data technologies.

You are welcome to use any software package and consult external reference materials (web, textbooks, articles, product manuals, etc.), but all work must be your own.


### **Setup**
Please download the following dataset which contains the song played by Last.fm’s users.

We recommend you to read the documentation page and get familiarized with the dataset before starting. You may find additional metadata and information about the dataset in the link below. You also may download the dataset directly from here:

### **Assignment**

Using Spark (Scala/Java) or PySpark on any infrastructure of your choice, please answer the following question:

If we define a user ‘session’ to be composed of one or more songs played by that user, where each song is started within 20 minutes of the previous song’s start time, create a list of the top 10 songs played in the top 50 longest sessions by tracks count. Please provide a tab separated text file with your answer, along with all scripts, tools and info needed to execute the test.


### **Submission**

Please submit:
- All code and output files either as a zip and sent to the recruiter. Please, we kindly ask refraining from sharing the solution publicly (i.e. public git repository).
- A README containing instructions for how to run your application, why you chose the technologies you did, and things you could improve on if you had more time (especially if this work will be considered to be deployed in Production).
- You may add to the README any assumptions and/or actions driven by data discovery and data quality matters regarding the dataset.
- There is no need to submit the input dataset, yet we _do_ expect the required output as part of the submission.
